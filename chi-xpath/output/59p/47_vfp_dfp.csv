As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., ?Anything goes in this sex andron?; ?That is love, this is commerce. What are you into??); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door. The words ?f**k? and ?sh*t? are heard in the game.","System Requirements","Minimum:","OS:","Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64bit versions only)","Processor:","AMD FX 6300 @ 3.8 GHz, Ryzen 3 - 1200, Intel Core i5 2400 @ 3.1 GHz (MORE DETAILS","HERE","Memory:","8 GB RAM","Graphics:","AMD Radeon R9 285, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 (2GB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0) (MORE DETAILS","HERE","DirectX:","Version 11","Storage:","46+ GB available space","Additional Notes:","Video Preset: Lowest (720p)","Recommended:","OS:","Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64bit versions only)","Processor:","AMD FX-8350 @ 4.0 GHz, Ryzen 5 - 1400, Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.5 GHz or better (MORE DETAILS","HERE","Memory:","8 GB RAM","Graphics:","AMD Radeon R9 290, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (4GB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0) or better (MORE DETAILS","HERE","Storage:","46+ GB available space","Additional Notes:","Video Preset: High (1080p)","� 2018 Ubisoft Entertainment.
