A volunteer firefighter reportedly burned on the island was transported to a hospital in Athens.","?The most important thing is to not have any human casualties,? Interior Minister Takis Theodorikakos said in a telephone interview aired on state television.","Smoke from the Evia fire blanketed Athens in the morning. Authorities warned people in affected areas, particularly the elderly, young children and those suffering from breathing or heart conditions, to remain indoors and set air conditioning units to recycle indoor air.","The blaze broke out shortly after 3 a.m. local time, the civil protection authority said, and strong winds helped spread it through the dense pine forest.","More than 300 people from four villages were gradually evacuated during the day, many riding on buses and others going out in their own vehicles.","?The fire trapped us at Makrimalli, and we had to leave quickly,? said Nikos Petrou, referring to one of the villages that were ordered evacuated. ?As I was leaving, the fire was coming behind us.?","A separate blaze broke out on the north part of Evia, and 15 firefighters, a helicopter and a small plane worked to keep it from spreading.","Dozens more firefighters, two planes and a helicopter tackled a separate forest fire on the northern island of Thassos. Another wildfire was burning through brush and dried weeds near Thebes, northwest of Athens.","More than 30 firefighters tackled yet another in southern Greece; the fire department said it was brought under partial control after about an hour.","On Tuesday afternoon, an additional blaze broke out in southern Greece.","Forest fires are common in Greece during the hot, dry summer months. Authorities have repeatedly warned the public not to engage in outdoor activities that could cause fires, such as welding work, burning dried weeds or lighting campfires and barbecues. Parks and forest areas are closed to the public at times of high fire risk.","Last year, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire broke out in a seaside area northeast of Athens and raged through a nearby settlement of mainly holiday homes. The fire trapped people in their cars as they attempted to flee, while many other victims drowned as they tried to swim away from beaches overcome by heat and choking smoke.
